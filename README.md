PROMS Server
============
PROMS Server is an application designed to manage enterprise provenance information from a series of "reporting systems" that send it to it. it consists of a RESTful API (Python Flask) both enforces data policy according for incoming provenance data and also makes that data available in several ways. PROMS works as an application layer on top of an RDF triplestore (graph database) and required a web server to put it online.
