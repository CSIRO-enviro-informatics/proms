# PROMS Server
Part of an organisation's provenance solution.


## About
![PROMS Purpose](docs/PromsPurpose.png)  
*Figure 1: PROMS Purpose*  

The main purpose of PROMS Server is to collect and store provenance information generated by workflows and automated processes. PROMS Server is an API that sits on top of any standard [SPARQL 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/). triplestore.

PROMS Server checks that provenance sent to it is compliant with the [PROV Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) and a few other rules designed to ensure the provenance is managed well.


## Components
PROMS Server consists of an HTTP API coded in Python 3.6 using the Flask framework. It relies heavily on the [rdflib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdflib) Python module for manipulating RDF and a range of other fairly mainstream Python modules. The human HTML UI also uses the JavaScript [rdflib.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdflib) code for RDF manipulation.
